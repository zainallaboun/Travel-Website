The piece of code that I am most proud of is the code that I did for the map. I am unable to provide a screenshot for it because the code is too long. However, this code is quite complex and uses a variety of javascript properties such as functions and arrays. The way that the map works is quite detailed. There are 195 countries. There is 1 variable that represents each country and when clicked, the name of the country appears. In order to do this feature, I created a function, which depending on the variable clicked, would give a different answer. This can be labelled as an attribute given by a function that occurs when clicking on a certain variable. Additionally, the arrays found in the code are used in order to determine the postition of each country relative to the rest of the map. In order to style the map, I created a style sheet which I later linked to the head of the home page. This style sheet controls the colors of the map. These colors include: the display color of the mpa, the border of the map and the color of the map when hovered on by a mouse.
